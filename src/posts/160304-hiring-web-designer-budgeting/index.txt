In this series of posts, I want to prepare you for some of the conversations that you will need to have with your potential new designer before work can ever begin.

note: This information could be applied to any type of project or situation where you are hiring outside help but for sanity's sake, let's just call it a website design project and know that the terms: designer, consultant, and agency are all interchangeable here.

Alright, so you've decided that your business needs a website and you being the smart business owner that you are, know that your job is selling fuzzy kitten slippers and not building websites! This means that it's time to find a pro. You've narrowed down your choices to a few agencies that you would like to work with and now you are ready to contact them. Before picking up the phone though, there's a few things that you need to have prepared.

Finding the right designer or agency can sometimes be a huge headache and very time-consuming. A few obvious facts:
1. Headaches are no fun.
2. Your time is valuable.
3. Your designers time is valuable.

# Know Your Design Project Budget. (And Talk About It)

This probably seems counter-intuitive. You may be thinking, "If I tell my designer how much I'm willing to spend, then I'll lose all of my negotiating power." I mean, you wouldn't do this when you are wanting to buy a used car would you? Heck no!

The problem with this thinking is that design services like websites or logos are not as easily priced as used cars. There's no Kelly Blue Book value for website design. Every agency and every designer will have different price points and different ways of getting to that price. A good agency should sit down with you, ask you a lot of questions about the project, and then build a custom website for your business based on your answers that meets your needs, fulfills your goals, (hopefully) helps you make money, and makes your heart tingle a little.

The process of getting to a final price on your web design project is far more involved than negotiating a final sales price of something like a used car and then never seeing the car salesman again. When you hire a designer, you are partnering with a company that should truly want to see you succeed and grow. Not just bleed you dry of your hard-earned fuzzy kitten slippers revenue. Success for your business means success for their business.

You may not know your exact budget yet but chances are, you have a price range in your mind of what you could afford to spend on your new website. Sharing this information can make things much easier for everyone involved.

## Knowing your budget can let the agency know if they can afford to take on the project

For example, if your budget for a new website is $1000 and your designers starting price is $3000, then everyone instantly knows that this probably isn't going to work out or that maybe you should re-evaluate your budget. Either way, having an up-front conversation with your designer about this will help. It's pretty frustrating to wait a week or two for a well written project proposal only to find out there's no way you would ever be able to afford this person. On the flip side, maybe your budget is $50,000 and your designers average site is normally around $5000\. This could mean that he may not be up to the task of meeting your businesses needs and goals.
There are many factors that go into what an agencies starting/average price is so don't write them off based solely on money. They might be able to come up with some creative pricing options.

## Knowing your budget lets the designer come up with creative pricing if needed

Like I already said, there are many factors that go into pricing a website design. For us, if your budget and our price point don't exactly line up, this doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to start avoiding your calls. There are many things that can possibly be done to help get us on the same page. Like:

* Adjust features or assets that are included.
* Set up a payment plan.
* Exchange services. (I know of a designer that traded design work for an expensive dental procedure when he didn't have the money for.)

Within reason, there should always be a little give and take from both sides of the table.

## Being straightforward about your budget sets the tone for an open and honest conversation

I can't speak for all designers, but for me, I truly want to help businesses, even if that means directing them to another agency more suited to meet their needs. One of the things we love to do at Tube Media is consulting with businesses to figure out exactly what they need to grow. Not every business needs a full-blown website. If we discover through our conversations that you don't actually need the “full shebang” e-commerce solution with all the bells and whistles, well, then selling that to you wouldn't be in our long-term best interest (or yours for that matter.)

If you really don't have any idea about where your budget should be for your design project, or how much you should pay for this type of thing, you are not alone. The design industry is all over the place in terms of pricing and services offered and they change drastically from one agency to the next. If you need help figuring this stuff out, feel free to contact us and we'll be your tour guide.

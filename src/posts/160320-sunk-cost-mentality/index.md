## What Owning a business and Owning a Motorcycle have in Common

Motorcycle riders are called organ donors for a reason. Because if they ride long enough, the will wreck. It’s just a question of when.

Owning a business is the same way. Every successful business owner will fail, probably multiple times if we are being honest. To borrow a line from famous tv biker Jax Teller on _Son’s of Anarchy,_ “That’s the price you pay for not being stuck in a cage (read car).”<span id="more-4354"></span>

What separates the good entrepreneur from the bad one is not the failure, its what you do with it. Did you learn from it? Good! Now don’t fail the same way next time.

While we are on the subject of failure, let’s talk about sunk-cost mentality. Sunk cost mentality is the reason you still have a closet full of clothes that don’t fit anymore. Every time you think about getting rid of them, you tell yourself that maybe, just maybe, you’ll be able to wear them again one day. It’s the reason that I have an old Volkswagen in my back yard that I’ve spent so much time trying to fix that I don’t want to just let it go, even though it hasn’t run in about a year. If I get rid of it now, all that time I’ve spent will have been a waste.

What sunk cost does to your business though is it makes you keep throwing money and time at a product or service or marketing campaign when really, you should just take it out back and put it out of it’s (and your) misery. Good business owners know when it’s time to kill something. They can acknowledge that something isn’t working, learn from those failures, and move on to something else that will be more profitable to their business.

If you have something that’s been holding your business back, the sooner you kill it, the better. If you are too blinded by your sunk cost to make an unbiased decision, bring in a third-party to look at the data and help you make the call. Part of our business is consulting with owners, to provide fresh eyes to a project, and to help you make some of those hard decisions. This isn’t a sales pitch though. There are others that do this same thing. Talk to some of them. The money you spend by bringing in a good consultant will be made up for many times over in savings when they help you kill that dead-end project.

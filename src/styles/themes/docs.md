### Themes

**Feel free to remove this directory for projects that don't need this level of structure**

On larger sites and applications, you may need to have different themes. One way to do this is by having theme-specific files in a `themes/` directory.http://sass-guidelin.es/#themes-folder

*Note â€” This is very project-specific and is likely to be unnecessary on many projects.*
